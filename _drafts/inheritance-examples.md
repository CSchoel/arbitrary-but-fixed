title:  "Good examples for inheritance"

    We all know the examples for inheritance given in text books: Student extends Person, Dog extends Animal, Square extends Rectangle, Truck extends Car, ... but what about true real-life examples where inheritance is not just a requirement imposed by the teacher, but simply the most elegant and straightforward solution?

We all know the examples for inheritance given in text books: `Student extends Person`, `Dog extends Animal`, `Truck extends Car`, `Square extends Rectangle`, ... but how often have you really written a piece of software that contained a class like that (or even something similar)?

## `Square extends Rectangle` is dangerous

Sub_set_ vs Sub_class_

## Why can't we use an interface?

## An Attempt at some better examples

### Inventory

(Car parts, online shop, ...)

### Rectangle extends 2D-Shape

### Data-Streams

### GUIs

### Game-Engines

CCG Card types, Enemy/Entity Types (can be destroyed, can attack back, ...)

### Conversions

Currency, Temperature, Angular Units

### Design-Patterns

Strategy pattern
Factory method pattern
Abstract Factory pattern
