title:  "The lyapunov exponent of the logistic map: plotting and approximation"
description: >
    The logistic map is a very nice simple time series that can be used to test algorithms that approximate the lyapunov exponent.
    In this post I want to explain how to calculate the actual lyapunov exponent and discuss some approximation algorithms for this example.
