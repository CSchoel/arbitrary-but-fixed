title: "The pitfalls of using proper SI units: Nominal values and zero crossings in Modelica"
description: >
    Using proper SI units without unit prefixes avoids order of magnitude errors and increases interoperability between models.
    However, they can also bring some pitfalls with them.
    In this post I explain how to avoid those in Modelica by using nominal values and paying special attention to zero crossings.
