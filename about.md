## The blog

As a researcher in an interdisciplinary field, incurable perfectionist, and generally curious and quirky person I tend to run into interesting and sometimes exotic <del>problems</del> challenges.
In this blog I want to shout my solutions to these challenges out into the world, hoping for some feedback.
So if you have a question, or a better solution, or just want to chat with someone with similar interests, I am always happy if you drop me an email.

## Myself

I got my Master's degree in computer science from the [Technical University Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/startseite/) with a focus on machine learning.
Currently, I am a teacher and PhD student at the [Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen](http://thm.de) - a university of applied sciences in Gie√üen (Germany) - where I study the benefits of the language [Modelica](http://modelica.org/) for the modeling of complex biological systems.

For me, a good day is a day where I learned something new.
Therefore I tend to have quite a large pile of side projects both related to my work and my personal interests.

In this blog you may read stories from both my research and my spare time.
