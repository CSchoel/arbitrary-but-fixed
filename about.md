## The blog

As an AI engineer with a background in academia, and generally curious person, I tend to run into interesting and sometimes exotic <del>problems</del> challenges.
In this blog, I want to shout my solutions to these challenges out into the world, hoping for some feedback.
So if you have a question, or a better solution, or just want to chat with someone with similar interests, I am always happy if you drop me an email.

This blog was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the following plugins:

- jekyll-feed
- jekyll-email-protect
- jekyll-sitemap
- jekyll-seo-tag
- jemoji

It uses a modified version of the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) with the fonts [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans), [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand).
The HTML contend is served via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the syntax highlighter is [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/), Markdown parsing is provided by [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/).

## Myself

I got my Master's degree in computer science from the [Technical University Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/startseite/) with a focus on machine learning.
After that I was a teacher and did my PhD at the bioinformatics department of the [Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen](http://thm.de) - a University of Applied Sciences in Gießen (Germany).
Today, I work as an AI engineer at [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/).

For me, a good day is a day when I learned something new.
Therefore, I tend to have quite a large pile of side projects, both related to my work and my personal interests.

In this blog, you may read stories from both my work life and my spare time.
