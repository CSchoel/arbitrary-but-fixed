As a researcher in an interdisciplinary field, incurable perfectionist, and generally curious and quirky person I tend to run into pretty interesting and sometimes exotic <del>problems</del> challenges.
In this blog I want to shout my solutions to these challenges out into the world, hoping for some feedback. So if you have a question, or a better solution, or just want to chat with someone with similar interests, I am always happy if you drop me an email.
