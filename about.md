## The blog

As a researcher in an interdisciplinary field, incurable perfectionist, and generally curious and quirky person I tend to run into pretty interesting and sometimes exotic <del>problems</del> challenges.
In this blog I want to shout my solutions to these challenges out into the world, hoping for some feedback.
So if you have a question, or a better solution, or just want to chat with someone with similar interests, I am always happy if you drop me an email.

## Myself

I am a teacher and PhD student at the [Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen](http://thm.de) - a university of applied sciences in Germany.
I study the benefits of the language [Modelica](http://modelica.org/) for the modeling of complex biological systems (but I usually have a quite large pile of side projects in my spare time).
I got my Master's degree in computer science from the Technical University Kaiserslautern with a focus on machine learning.
